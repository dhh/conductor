# Conductor

Conductor is a Rails engine that lets you do through a web UI what you'd normally do with the rails shell command.

## Installation & Setup

To install add the following line to the Gemfile in your Rails  application :

```
gem 'conductor', :git => 'https://github.com/NewRosies/conductor.git', :require => 'conductor/engine'
