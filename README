Conductor is a Rails engine that lets you do through a web UI what you'd normally do with the rails shell command.

* Installation & Setup

To install add the following line to the Gemfile in your Rails 3 application :

  gem 'conductor', :git => 'https://github.com/NewRosies/conductor.git', :require => 'conductor/engine'

Then run the conductor:install:assets rake command.

Conductor can now be accessed at /conductor when you're running off local host.
